/** Q10
 * This program calculates and prints the product of odd numbers from 1 to 15.
 * (Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., 15)
 * 
 * Problem Flow:
 * Start from 1 to 15
 * Increment by 2 to get odd numbers
 * Multiply all odd numbers
 * Print the final product
 * 
 * Input / Output Example:
 * Output:
 * Product of odd numbers from 1 to 15 = 2027025
 * (Odd numbers: 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 × 11 × 13 × 15 = 2027025)
