/** Q9
 * This program finds the sum of even numbers between 2 and 30 (inclusive).
 * 	
 * Problem Flow:
 * Start loop from 2 to 30
 * Check if number is even (i % 2 == 0)
 * Add to sum
 * Print final sum
 * 
 * Input / Output Example:
 * Output:
 * Sum of even numbers from 2 to 30 = 240
 * (Even numbers: 2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 30 = 240)
